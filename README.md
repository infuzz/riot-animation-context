# riot-animation-context riot tag (animation-context)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/any-code/riot-animation-context.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/any-code/riot-animation-context)

> Riot JS Tag animation context for dealing with css transitions and animated addition and removal of riot tags or just dynamically ineracting with css animations

## Demonstration

[riot-animation-context](https://infuzz.github.io/riot-animation-context/test/ "riot-animation-context - Anycode on GitHub")

Includes animate.css for base animations, these can be overridden or added to in external css.

## Why not just use animate.css

You can still use animate.css. This tag helps when dynamically mounting riotjs tags and causing some animation effects to occur. Because
the animation can be controlled through opts, the effects themselves can be dynamically changed and played. 

The other benefit is that it handles animation on `unmount` of riot tags nicely.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

``` bash
npm install riot-animation-context
```

### 2. Examples

``` javascript
   
   require('riot-animation-context')
   
```

the following `animation-context` when mounted will immediately `rubberBand`, then wait 2000ms and `lightSpeedOut` note that inner scope belongs to `animation-context` so to call methods and interact with opts and properties of the outer tag the parent property is required. Because `animate-on-mount` is `true`, the `animate-out` will also cause the animation-context to `unmount` once it is finished.

``` html

<my-riot-tag>
    <!-- animate anything inside the animation context -->
    <animation-context name="animator"
        animate-on-mount="true" 
        animate-infinitely="true" 
        animate-in="rubberBand" 
        animate-auto-out-delay="2000"
        animate-out="lightSpeedOut"
        >
        <button onclick={ parent.becomeAwesome }>CLICK ME TO <em>BECOME AWESOME</em></button>
    </animation-context>

    <script>
        // By assigning a name to the animation context you can use it 
        // as in the following code sample:-
        // this.animator.in()
        // this.animator.out()
        // in() and out() font need to be manually called because we have 
        // supplied the animate-on-mount="true" attribute
        
        this.becomeAwesome = function() {
            alert('impossible!')
        }
    </script>
</my-riot-tag>

<script>
    riot.mount('my-riot-tag');
</script>
```
